# Shadcn Admin Dashboard

Admin Dashboard UI built with Shadcn and React Router v7. Built with responsiveness and accessibility in mind.

I've been creating dashboard UIs at work and for my personal projects. I always wanted to make a reusable collection of dashboard UI for future projects; and here it is now. While I've created a few custom components, some of the code is directly adapted from ShadcnUI examples.

> This is not a starter project (template) though. I'll probably make one in the future.
